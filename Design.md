-> [Core Services publish test messages to RabbitMQ broker]
-> [Messages traverse configured exchanges/queues]
-> [Core Services fetch real-time stats from Management API]
-> [Core Services aggregates results (latency, # messages, etc.)]
-> [API/Controllers returns simulation outcome]
-> [Frontend updates real-time visualization of message flow].


	3.	Debugging & Pattern Analysis

	•	Backend:
	•	Fetches topology info from RabbitMQ Management API (if connected to a real cluster) or from local definitions.
	•	Provides a REST endpoint GET /api/topologies/{id} to retrieve structured data for rendering.

UI/UX Wireframe Description
	•	A central canvas with nodes (queues) and edges (bindings) linking to exchange shapes.
	•	Hovering over a queue or exchange shows metadata: message depth, consumer count, etc.

  "id": "topology-123",
  "name": "My First Topology",
  "exchanges": [
    {
      "name": "exchange.logs",

	•	DebugHub: Pushes new trace or exception events to debugging views.
	•	Pub/sub (internal) might also use RabbitMQ for asynchronous tasks among microservices.

5.4 Data Persistence Strategy
	•	SQL or Document DB:
	•	Store topologies, user settings, learning module progress, and shared knowledge base.
	•	In-Memory Cache (Redis or built-in .NET memory cache):
	•	Speeds up repeated retrieval of popular topologies or large sets of metrics.
	•	File Storage:
	•	For storing scenario scripts or user-exported configurations.

5.5 Security Considerations
	•	Authentication:
	•	OAuth or Token-based authentication for user sessions, especially if multi-tenant or cloud-hosted.
	•	Authorization:
	•	Fine-grained roles: read-only (learner), designer, admin.
	•	Encryption in Transit:
	•	TLS for both the front-end (HTTPS) and RabbitMQ (AMQP over TLS if needed).
	•	Secrets Management:
	•	Use .NET User Secrets or environment variables for storing RabbitMQ credentials.

5.6 Performance Optimization Strategies
	•	Asynchronous I/O in .NET 8 controllers and services.
	•	Message Batching in simulations to reduce overhead.
	•	Load Testing:
	•	Integration with scenario simulator ensures the application can handle heavy throughput.
	•	Caching:
	•	Offload repeated queries to RabbitMQ Management API with a local in-memory or Redis cache.

5.7 Docker Containerization Approach
